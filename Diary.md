***18 March 2020*** 

Tomorrow I run a CS2900 lab. I plan to a) run this from my home (one of my kid's school is closed) b) allow students to do this remotely

I have a TA who can help out as well.

**Material** 

During this course I've set up a series of Jupyter Notebooks to cover a series of topics. These can be launched from mybinder. this year I've found that mybinder isn't as stable as last year so students have also been making use of google colab. This is more stable but I'm less happy with the interface, particularly with respect to where files are stored. For next year I may try and give a containerised version of the notebooks as well so that they can run them on their own laptops.

The really nice thing about notebooks is that they are all so-self contained but people still need to ask questions. We need a platform for that.

Options The first choice is Microsoft Teams. RHUL has a site licence for this and in the light of covid-19 has accelerated its adoption. All the students have accounts on this and it ticks the box in terms of using something that is centrally run and supported. It has lots of good features. It has video conferencing and chat with the latter being essential and the former a nice to have. There are stand alone clients for Windows and Apple (but no Linux) and there is a standalone web interface as well. There are other features such as sharing documents which aren't necessary here.

But - problems. The first is the deal killer. I started the Teams client this afternoon and it's not been connecting to the service. This has been an issue this week and hence I can't depend on it right now. As an additonal point - the service has had to be deployed very quickly by College and they are definitely playing catch up. At present only central IT can set up teams and they don't have one for the cohort. I can still send a link to the meeting but going forward it's hard to see how we can keep comments etc.

The second option is slack. I've used slack a little bit and am definitely still a newbie to this. I managed to remind myself how to set up a new slack group. This will just have chat but but should be sufficient. That said, I reminded myself of the dictum that CS students often are less aware of industry-level tools as one might think. So, instead I'm going to try


**Piazza**. This tool is as far as I can see a simple forum for students to use. Crucially this cohort have been making use of it so there shouldn't be any problems in terms of getting set up. I may well still have to inform my TA about how to use it though.

I don't have the video functionality but that's okay - previously when I was away at a conference I recorded a quicktime viedo and posted it up on moodle for them to have a look at. I can do this tonight.

Getting a Piazza login id is relatively straight forward. I'll need to post out to the students a link so that they can enroll themselves. I could also enroll the TA as well directly which is good. I'll make an announcement to the students now.

Video Over the years I've used Quicktime as a) it's on my laptop and b) you can create a slidecast with effectively one option selected. RHUL has provided a tool called Panopto and I've decided to give that a try as well. This is a commerical tool with an standalone client. What is apparenrtly nice is that you can have images from the screen and frmo a webcam recorded at the same time. All this gets uploaded to a site which integrates with the RHUL moodle. I still need to figure out how to do the two screen business (I have a web cam now so the hope is I can have a split screen with audio - one screen showing my lecture notes and the other showing me scribbling on a page). I'll let you know if I get that to work. In any case I've done a simple slidecast and posted it up onto out moodle page.

Very low turn out and no questions on Piazza for the lab. I don't know if that's because we're close to the end of term or students don't want to engage this way or something is catastrophically wrong with this process :^( 

I had a conference call today for a staff student committee meeting. I've decided to use Teams on this. Teams appears to be up and running today BUT 
.) we have students and staff who use linux boxes and have to use the web client
.) admin staff who can't use other tools such as skype (as it's not installed)

Much chaos in the half hour beforehand. Many students couldn't log into Teams. It turns up you need to do an initial sign in to the service before you can log in on a regular basis. More cognitive load.

Otherwise the call itself was okay - good quality audio; chat and cojld upload files to share. 

Will try and get to doing the video using webcam of drawing on paper using panopto but probably tomorrow. 

Nice discusson from @natalieharrower on the questions to consider in choosing conference call software on

Other wild thought - Twitch. I have no idea of what the functionality is there but it would be battle-hardened so anybody could use it.
